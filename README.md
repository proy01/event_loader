# Event Loader

A new Flutter project

This project showcases the following flutter concepts:

1. Calling Api
2. Building Custom AppBar using PreferredSizeWIdget
3. Building widgets dynamically by api calls
4. Implementing a search function that also uses api
5. Adding custom fonts
6. Using network images
7. Navigation betweeen named routes
8. Passing information between screens

The project also uses CLEAN architecture and the MVC model in the features folder to enable scalability at a future stage. No State management has been used as it was not required.
